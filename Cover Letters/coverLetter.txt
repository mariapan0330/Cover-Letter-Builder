Dear Hiring Manager, 

I’m happy to see that the position of drole is available at dcom! As a full-stack developer with experience in Java and Python, I am excited to put my skills to use maintaining and improving the user experience you have perfected. 

My experience in full-stack development specializing in Python, JavaScript, SQL, PostgreSQL, Flask, and React makes me an ideal candidate for this role. I love the problem-solving process of learning new things and fine-tuning my skills, and I consistently ensure a thorough design that accounts for edge cases and provides an intuitive end-user experience. 

I value the knowledge gained through diverse experiences, and I believe I provide a unique skill set to the teams you are building. I graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a BA in Psychology, with a minor in Sociology. I also had the opportunity to travel in Europe as an international student and to practice public relations and communications in my position as the PR officer in a college society. 

These experiences, along with my coding experience and personal projects leave me in an optimal position to both learn from my participation and benefit your team at dcom. 

Sincerely,
Maria Panagos
