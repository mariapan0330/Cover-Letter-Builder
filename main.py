    Iâ€™m happy to see that the position of {role} is available at {company}! As a full-stack developer with experience in Java and Python, I am excited to put my skills to use maintaining and improving the user experience you have perfected. <br/><br/>

    My experience in full-stack development specializing in Python, JavaScript, SQL, PostgreSQL, Flask, and React makes me an ideal candidate for this role. I love the problem-solving process of learning new things and fine-tuning my skills, and I consistently ensure a thorough design that accounts for edge cases and provides an intuitive end-user experience. <br/><br/>

    I value the knowledge gained through diverse experiences, and I believe I provide a unique skill set to the teams you are building. I graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a BA in Psychology, with a minor in Sociology. I also had the opportunity to travel in Europe as an international student and to practice public relations and communications in my position as the PR officer in a college society. <br/><br/>

    These experiences, along with my coding experience and personal projects leave me in an optimal position to both learn from my participation and benefit your team at {company}. <br/><br/>

    Sincerely,<br/>
    Maria Panagos
